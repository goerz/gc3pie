## the script itself

class GCodemlScript(SessionBasedScript):
    """
    Scan the specified INPUTDIR directories recursively for '.ctl' files,
    and submit a CODEML job for each input file found; job progress is
    monitored and, when a job is done, its '.mlc' file is retrieved back
    into the same directory where the '.ctl' file is (this can be
    overridden with the '-o' option).
    
    The `gcodeml` command keeps a record of jobs (submitted, executed and
    pending) in a session file (set name with the '-s' option); at each
    invocation of the command, the status of all recorded jobs is updated,
    output from finished jobs is collected, and a summary table of all
    known jobs is printed.  New jobs are added to the session if new input
    files are added to the command line.
    
    Options can specify a maximum number of jobs that should be in
    'SUBMITTED' or 'RUNNING' state; `gcodeml` will delay submission
    of newly-created jobs so that this limit is never exceeded.
