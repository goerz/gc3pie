Installation
============

These instructions show how to install the GC3Utils from the GC3 svn
repository into their own python environment.

0. Prerequisites are: ``svn`` (package ``subversion`` in CentOS5 and
   Debian/Ubuntu), the Python development headers and libraries (package
   ``python-devel`` in CentOS5, ``python-dev`` in Debian/Ubuntu).
   These should be available in any decent Linux distribution.


1. If it's not already installed, get the `virtualenv` Python package
   and install it::

      wget http://bitbucket.org/ianb/virtualenv/get/tip.gz#egg=virtualenv-tip
      tar -xzf tip.tar.gz && rm tip.tar.gz 
      cd virtualenv/
 
    If you are installing as `root`, the following command is all you
    need:

      python setup.py install

    If instead you are installing as a normal, unprivileged user,
    things get more complicated::

      export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
      export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
      mkdir -p $HOME/lib/python
      python setup.py install --home $HOME

    (You will also need to add the two `export` lines above to the
    `$HOME/.bashrc` file -if using the `bash` shell- or to the
    `$HOME/.cshrc` file -if using the `tcsh` shell.)

    In any case, once `virtualenv` has been installed, you can exit
    its directory and remove it:
   
      cd ..
      rm -rf virtualenv


2. Create a virtuelnv to host the ``gc3pie`` installation::

       virtualenv gc3pie
       cd gc3pie/
       source bin/activate


3. Check-out the ``gc3pie`` files in a ``src/`` directory::
     
       svn co http://gc3pie.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gc3pie src
   
  
4. Install the ``gc3pie`` in "develop" mode, so any modification
   pulled from subversion is immediately reflected in the running environment::

       cd src/
       env CC=gcc ./setup.py develop 
       cd .. # back into the `gc3pie` directory

   This will place all the Gc3pie command into the ``gc3pie/bin/``
   directory.

5. Before you can actually run the Gc3pie, you need to have a
   working configuration file; `the ConfigurationFile Wiki page
   <http://code.google.com/p/gc3pie/wiki/ConfigurationFile>` provides
   an explanation of the syntax to use in configuration files.

   In order to use the ARC backend, you need the NorduGrid/ARC
   binaries installed on the same machine where Gc3pie are.
   You can find instructions for installing ARC at:
   http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/ng-client-install.html


   
Upgrade
=======

These instructions show how to upgrade the Gc3pie scripts to the
latest version found in the GC3 svn repository.

1. `cd` to the directory containing the Gc3pie virtualenv;
   assuming it's named ``gc3pie`` as in the above installation
   instructions, you can issue the commands::

     cd gc3pie/src

2. Upgrade the `gc3pie` source and run the `setup.py` script again:

     svn up
     env CC=gcc ./setup.py develop
