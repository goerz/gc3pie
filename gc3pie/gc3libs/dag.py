Implementation of task collections.

Tasks can be grouped into collections, which are tasks themselves,
therefore can be controlled (started/stopped/cancelled) like a single
whole.  Collection classes provided in this module implement the basic
patterns of job group execution; they can be combined to form more
complex workflows.  Hook methods are provided so that derived classes
can implement problem-specific job control policies.
