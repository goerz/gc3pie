Environment Variables
=====================

The following environmental variables affect GC3Pie operations.

`GC3PIE_CONF`

  Path to an additional configuration file, that is read upon
  initialization of GC3Pie.  If undefined or empty, no additional
  configuration file is loaded.


`GC3PIE_NO_CATCH_ERRORS`

  When set to any value, GC3Pie will not act on unexpected/generic
  errors (by default, ignoring them) and instead propagates the
  exception all the way up to top-level.  This facilitates running
  GC3Pie scripts in a debugger and inspecting the code when some
  unexpected error condition happens.
