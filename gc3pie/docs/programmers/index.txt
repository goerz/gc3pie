  Programmer Documentation
============================

This document is the technical reference for the GC3Libs programming
model, aimed at programmers who want to use GC3Libs to implement
computational workflows in Python.

We suggest you to start from the :ref:`Programming Overview` section,
that gives you an overview of the main components of the library and
how they interact with each other.

When you are familiar with the main concepts of GC3Pie library, we
would suggest you to take a look at the various `tutorials`_ that have
info on very specific topics and are very easy to understand,
especially the :ref:`warholize tutorial`, that is a thorough tutorial
that will show you how to write a very complex GC3Pie application step
by step.

The :ref:`GC3Libs` section instead contains the API reference of
GC3Pie library.

   * Higher level documentation (like the "Programming Overview" page,
     which should be extended to add scripts), including a little
     overview of the UML diagram.
   * tutorials, including slides from last gc3pie 2012 training and the
   * warholize script
   * gc3libs API reference
