============================
  Programmer Documentation
============================

This document is the technical reference for the GC3Libs programming
model, aimed at programmers who want to use GC3Libs to implement
computational workflows in Python.

The :ref:`Programming Overview` section is the starting point for
whoever wants to start developing applications with GC3Pie. It gives
you an overview of the main components of the library and how they
interact with each other.


The `Tutorials`_ section contains documentation that describes in more
detail the various component discussed in the programming overview, as
long as many working examples (took from exercises done during the
training events) and the :ref:`warholize tutorial`, that is a thorough
tutorial that will show you how to write a very complex GC3Pie
application step by step.

The :ref:`GC3Libs` section instead contains the API reference of
GC3Pie library.
