  GC3Pie programming tutorials
================================


Slides on specific topics
-------------------------

This is a list of tutorials made for the `GC3Pie 2012 Training event`_
that has been held in Zurich on 1st and 2nd  of October 2012. The
slides and tutorials are an introduction to the GC3Pie python
package. 


`Introduction ot GC3Pie <part01.pdf>`_

    Introduction to the software.

`Basic GC3Pie programming <part03.pdf>`_

    The `Application` class, the smallest building block of
    GC3Pie. Introduction to the concept of Job, states of an
    application and to the `Core` class.

`Application requirements <part04.pdf>`_

    How to define extra requirements for an application, such as the
    minimum amount of memory it will use, the number of cores needed
    or the architecture of the CPUs.

`Managint applications: the SessionBasedScript class <part05.pdf>`_

    Introduction to the higest level interface to build applications
    with GC3Pie, the `SessionBasedScript`. Info on how to create
    simple scripts which will take care of the execution of your
    applications, from submission to getting back the results.

`GC3Pie utils <part06.pdf>`_

    Low level tools to debug your scripts.

`Introduction to Workflows with GC3Pie <part08.pdf>`_

    Using a practical example (the :ref:`warholize tutorial`) we show
    how workflows are implemented with GC3Pie. The following slides
    will cover in more details the single steps needed to produce a
    complex workflow.

`ParallelTaskCollection <part09.pdf>`_

    Description of the `ParallelTaskCollection` class, used to run
    tasks in parallel.

`StagedTaskCollection <part10.pdf>`_

    Description of the `StagedTaskCollection` class, used to run a
    sequence of a fixed number of jobs.

`SequentialTaskCollection <part11.pdf>`_

    Description of the `SequentialTaskCollection` class, used to run a
    sequence of jobs that can be altered during runtime.


Warholize Tutorial
------------------

A thorough tutorial that will show you how to write a very complex
GC3Pie application, step by step. The tutorial is developed in
`Literate Programming`_, which means that you can actually *compile*
the tutorial using `pylit`_ and get a working `wharolize.py` script.
