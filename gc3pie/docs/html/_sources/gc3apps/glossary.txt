  Core
    A single computing unit. This was called a *CPU* until manufacturers
    started packing many processing units into a single package: now the
    term CPU is used for the package, and *core* is one of the several
    independent processing units within the package.

  Job
    A computational job is a single run of a non-interactive
    application.  The prototypical example is a run of GAMESS_ on a
    single input file.

  Resource
    Short for "computational resource": any cluster or Grid where a job
    can run.

  Status
    A one-word indication of a computational job execution status (e.g.,
    ``RUNNING`` or ``TERMINATED``).

  Walltime
    Short for *wall-clock time*: indicates the total running time of a
    job.
